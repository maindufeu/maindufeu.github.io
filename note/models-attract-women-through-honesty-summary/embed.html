Only being interested in dating people who are interested in dating you. Worrying about what will make you happy instead of what will make someone else happy. Looking for a person who meets your needs instead of trying to always meet theirs. Changing yourself to become who you want to be, not what you think women want you to be.</li><li>To give an example, if a non-needy man meets a woman who rejects him or is not interested in him, he will assume that is was either an incompatibility or that it was just not the right situation.Either way, he will see it as the right thing to have happened. His life will go on.</li><li>A non-needy man doesn&rsquo;t try to control what women feel about him. Rather he tries to control what he feels about certain women. He understands that the world isn&rsquo;t about him and that all he can control is himself and his own actions. He&rsquo;s not bothered when things don&rsquo;t go his way or when people don&rsquo;t recognize him as being amazing because he already feels amazing himself. He doesn&rsquo;t need their approval and their disapproval doesn&rsquo;t faze him from his mission.</li><li>If every girl you date is unstable and crazy, that&rsquo;s a reflection of your emotional maturity level. It&rsquo;s a reflection of your confidence or lack of confidence. It&rsquo;s a reflection of your neediness.</li><li>Making yourself vulnerable doesn&rsquo;t just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you don&rsquo;t know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her.</li><li>I&rsquo;m not looking for sympathy or validation. I don&rsquo;t need anything from her. It&rsquo;s just who I am, rough edges and all.</li><li>A man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman&rsquo;s attention or affection through entertainment, money or superficiality is a man who is not confident in his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.</li><li>&ldquo;Let me know when you&rsquo;d like to get together again. If you&rsquo;re not interested, that&rsquo;s fine too.&rdquo;</li><li>Being less invested in any particular woman than she is invested in you will make her perceive you as attractive.</li><li>YOUR values determine your behavior, not what you think she wants, not what you think others want, but what is best for you and best for the relationship.</li><li>Our job is not to attract every woman, but to screen for women with a high potential of being attracted to who we really are.</li><li>The world is what it is, it&rsquo;s our job to simply present ourselves as boldly and clearly to it as possible, accept the reactions and move on the opportunities. Any attempt to control the reactions of others or take some kind of power over the reactions you receive is both foolish and illusory.</li><li>Rejection exists for a reason — it&rsquo;s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.</li><li>Ask yourself this: why would you want to be intimate with someone who doesn&rsquo;t appreciate you? Why would you ever settle for such a person? Because she&rsquo;s hot? Come on, have a little more self-respect. Have some higher standards.</li><li>A woman is Unreceptive is if she repeatedly does not reciprocate your signs of interest and/or shows you signs of disinterest.</li><li>The goal with Unreceptive women is to identify them and move on as quickly as possible.</li><li>Whatever it is, the goal with Neutral women is to take an action that forces her to make a decision about how she feels about you.</li><li>Women who are Receptive are women who are sexually/romantically attracted to you.</li><li>If she shuts you down, tells you to go away, tells you she&rsquo;s not interested, tells you she has a boyfriend, move on. Seriously, get over it and move on. You&rsquo;re wasting your time. I don&rsquo;t care how special you think she is, there&rsquo;s another one out there who&rsquo;s just as special who will be Receptive to you.</li><li>If she liked me enough, she&rsquo;d be willing to work at making it happen with me. And if she doesn&rsquo;t, then that just means it&rsquo;s wrong person — or right person, wrong time</li><li>If you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to meet her, to not take action and meet her is a form of being dishonest with yourself.</li><li>Be something attractive rather than to say something attractive.</li></ul></div></article><script></script></body></html>
